# CFD
Contains cfd codes including my original Matlab codes from university and updated python codes.
Codes:
  rmannsol.m - Matlab Reimann-solver using linearized reimann equations, gives the exact solution at any point xt
  reimann_solver.py - Python version, use the reimann_solver function to get values or use the output function to get a graph
  muscl.m - Matlab MUSCL-Hancock second-order solver, I remember it worked well when I last tried it but I have been having some issues with the Python port, there might be some unresolved issues
